                        Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect 
                        in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even 
                        hours to cast the spell. <span class="dmgdie">Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action.</span> Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, 
                        so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.

                            As an action on your turn, make a lore check. On a success, you teleport to an empty space behind a creature you can 
                            see within 30 feet. As part of this action, you may make one attack roll against the creature with advantage.<br><br>

                        The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, 
                        whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow,
                        or brawling with your fists.

                    <p class="actionblock"><span class="action">disengage</span><br>
                        If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks 
                        for the rest of the turn. 
                        <br><br><span class="source">Source: PHB, page 192.   </span></p>
                        
                    <p class="actionblock"><span class="action">dodge</span><br>
                        When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. 
                        Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against 
                        you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make <span class="skill">Dexterity Saving Throws</span> 
                        with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in 
                        the appendix) or if your speed drops to 0.
                        <br><br><span class="source">Source: PHB, page 192.   </span></p>
            
                    <p class="actionblock"><span class="action">dash</span><br>
                        When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals 
                        your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up 
                        to 60 feet on your turn if you dash. Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional 
                        movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move 
                        up to 30 feet this turn if you dash. 
                        <br><br><span class="source">Source: PHB, page 192.   </span></p>
            
                    <p class="actionblock"><span class="action">hide</span><br>
                        When you take the Hide action, you make a <span class="skill">Dexterity (Stealth)</span> check in an 
                        attempt to hide, following the rules in chapter 7 for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, 
                        as described in the "Unseen Attackers and Targets" section in the Player's Handbook. 
                        <br><br><span class="source">Source: PHB, page 192.   </span></p>
            
                    <p class="actionblock"><span class="action">disarm</span><br> 
                        A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker 
                        makes an attack roll contested by the target's  <span class="skill">Strength</span> (Athletics) check or 
                        <span class="skill">Dexterity (Acrobatics)</span> check. If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes 
                        no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item. The attacker has disadvantage on its attack 
                        roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check 
                        if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.
                        <br><br><span class="source">Source: PHB, page 192.   </span></p>  
                                
                    <p class="actionblock"><span class="action">help</span><br> 
                        You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature 
                        you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that 
                        it makes the check before the start of your next turn.<br><br>
                        Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the 
                        target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before 
                        your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.
                        <br><br><span class="source">Source: PHB, page 192.   </span></p>            
                        
                    <p class="actionblock"><span class="action">shove</span><br> 
                        Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it 
                        away from you. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.<br><br>
                        The target of your shove must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. You make a  
                        <span class="skill">Strength (Athletics)</span> check contested by the target's  <span class="skill">Strength (Athletics)</span> 
                        or <span class="skill">Dexterity (Acrobatics)</span> check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if 
                        the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.
                        <br><br><span class="source">Source: PHB, page 195.   </span></p>
                        
                    <p class="actionblock"><span class="action">grapple</span><br> 
                        When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If 
                        you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. The target of your grapple must be 
                        no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.<br><br>
                        Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check, a  <span class="skill">Strength (Athletics)</span> 
                        check contested by the target's  <span class="skill">Strength (Athletics)</span> or <span class="skill">Dexterity (Acrobatics)</span> 
                        check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you subject 
                        the target to the grappledcondition (see the appendix). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target 
                        whenever you like (no action required).
                        <br><br><span class="source">Source: PHB, page 192.   </span></p>   
            
                    <p class="actionblock"><span class="action">stabilize</span><br> 
                        You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful 
                        <span class="skill">DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine)</span> check.<br><br>
                        A stable creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops 
                        being stable, and must start making death  saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn't healed regains 
                        1 hit point after 1d4 hours.

                        You choose a creature you can see within range and mystically mark it as your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit

                    In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so 
                    provokes an opportunity attack.<br><br>
                    You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee 
                    attack against the provoking creature. The attack interrupts the provoking creature's movement, occurring right before the creature leaves your reach.<br><br>
                    You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something 
                    moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if gravity 
                    causes you to fall past an enemy.<br><br>
