                                    or brawling with your fists.</p>

                                    made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make <span class="skill">Dexterity</span> saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in 
                                    the appendix) or if your speed drops to 0.</p>

                                <td><p><span class="action">dash</span>  When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any 
                                    modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.
                                    Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 
                                    feet this turn if you dash.</p>

                                    Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check, a  <span class="skill">Strength (Athletics)</span> check contested by the target's  <span class="skill">Strength (Athletics)</span> or

                                     condition (see the appendix). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).</p>

                                    A stable creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death 
                                    saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.</p>
